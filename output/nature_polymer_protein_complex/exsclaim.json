The green diamonds represent the activity of a sample without inhibitor. The red diamonds represent the activity of the system containing 5% BTA-DNA, which was not diluted by addition of 100% BTA-3OH. b Kinetics of enzyme-inhibitor complex formation upon recruitment to the DNA-decorated polymers. Enzyme activity was measured at different time-point after adding the BTA polymers to a mixture of \u03b2-lactamase, BLIP RE and RI.
