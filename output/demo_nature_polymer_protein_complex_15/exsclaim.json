Turnover of a fluorescent substrate (CCF2-FA, 2\u2009\u03bcM) was monitored by measuring the fluorescence intensity at 447\u2009nm. Experiments were performed using 25% BTA-DNA (0.5\u2009\u03bcM BTA-DNA, 1.5\u2009\u03bcM BTA-3OH), 20\u2009nM RE and RI, 1\u2009nM \u03b2-lactamase and 10\u2009nM BLIP.

The laser-induced bleaching is highly localized (orange circles); non-activated regions (control) are also shown (blue circle). c, d Corresponding FRAP profiles showing time-dependent changes in fluorescence intensity (FI) recorded from the orange and blue circles shown in (a and b), respectively. Fluid and gel-like states are observed for the PVA and BSA surface layers, respectively. e Diffusion coefficients of PVA and BSA at the tributyrin/water interface confirming the gel or fluid states of the microphase-separated BSA or PVA domains, respectively. f Plots of complex modulus (E*) and viscosity of BSA and PVA microphases at pH = 7 and 3 (BSA only) at the air/water interface. CLSM fluorescence images for oil droplets with BSA (g) or PVA (h) continuous phases showing immobile or mobile microphase-separated PVA and BSA domains, respectively; Insets: Enlarged view of the yellow dashed area; RBITC-BSA, red fluorescence. i Changes of Pearson\u2019s correlation coefficient (PCC) over time showing the relationship of the microphase-separated state compared to the initial states. A PCC value close to 1.0 indicates that the fluorescence signals recorded at the same positions at different times and at time t\u2009=\u20090 are highly overlapping, while fluorescence signals approaching zero indicate that the two fluorescence signals are not correlated. The PCC values maintain near to 1.0 over time, which demonstrate that the relative position of the PVA domains did not change. The PCC values gradually decrease to zero due to changes in the relative positions of the discontinuous BSA domains. Data in (c\u2013f) and (i) are presented as mean values\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD, error bars indicate standard deviations (n\u2009=\u20093 independent experiments). All relevant experiments are performed independently three times with similar results. Source data are provided as a Source Data file.",

In left panel, GS remains in a resting state, FKS1 and Rho1 are separated, and the two proteins have not yet enriched or interacted with each other at the site of new cell wall synthesis. In middle panel, GS remains in an activation state upon the GDP/GTP exchange. GTP binding strengthens the interaction between Rho1 and FKS1, triggering conformational changes in both proteins. The FKS1 GT domain and TM7-15 undergo conformational shifts potentially influencing the active site and polymer translocation pathway, thereby pushes the elongated sugar chain out of the membrane channel. After the products UDP and Pi are released, GS returns to the GDP state again. In right panel, Structural interpretation of GS remains in a GDP state. Rho1, bound to GDP, and the \u03b13 helix interacts weakly with RIL loop in FKS1. The FKS1 GT domain and TM7-15 adopt a conformation incompatible with active sugar chain elongation. The nascent sugar chain stalls within the membrane channel formed by TM1-6 and TM7-15. In our model, GTP hydrolysis in Rho1 acts as the \u201cpower source\u201d of this cycle. Rho1\u2019s GTP-bound state allows \u201cforward\u201d movement of the sugar chain, while the GDP-bound state prevents backward movement.",

The solid white line denotes the straight-line distance employed for colocation analysis between DiI and FAM signals on the right. j The conformational content of APOs in APOs@BPmiRNA before and after incubation with lipid vesicles. k Schematic illustration of intracellular trafficking of APOs@BPmiRNA29. l The dynamic colocalization of APOs@BPCy5-miRNA (green) and lysosomes (red) in MSCs after incubation for 0.5 and 2\u2009h, respectively. m Intracellular accumulation and ROS-triggered dissociation of Cy5-miRNA (red) from polymerized carrier (FBP, green). Data were presented as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD (n\u2009=\u20095 independent samples in b; n\u2009=\u20096 independent samples in c; n\u2009=\u20093 independent samples in e, j;). Two-tailed unpaired t-test was used for statistical analysis of b, j. One-way ANOVA with Dunnett\u2019s multiple comparisons test was used for statistical analysis of c. Three independent experiments were performed with similar results and representative results are shown. Source data are provided as a Source Data file.",
