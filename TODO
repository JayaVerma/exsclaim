TODO

- Add BeautifulSoup to environment.yml
- In setup.sh, need to activate exsclaim_env from within file for proceeding code to download (gdown) the models (conda activate exsclaim within the bash script does not work)













- ===================== Complete (for the most part) =====================

- Deploy labeling interface in MTurk (ensuring compatibility with Labelbox)

- Decide on how to structure data from structured query --> labeled dataset. 
	Each figure returned from CDE has json associated with it 
	that contains the caption information, parsed caption information, [... other useful information to extract related to the figure as a whole], 
	and image level label information (like the json we use from MTurk), etc. ??

- Combine the fragmented processes to form single user-friendly tool:
	[0] webscraper (Ed has one for RSC journals)
		IN : structured-query
		OUT: folder of htmls
		STATUS: Ed is cleaning up the code?
		PERFORMANCE: ?

	[1] CDE_parser
		IN : folder of htmls, structured-query 
		OUT: folder of figures + .csv (figure path, caption text)
		STATUS: Complete
		PERFORMANCE: Works well for RSC journals (untested on others)

	[2] interpret_captions.py
		IN : .csv (figure path, caption text), structured-query 
		OUT: appended .csv (...predicted # of images, dict of associated caption text)
		STATUS: Operational
		PERFORMANCE: Untested (predicted # images appears adequate)

	[3] test.py (in ObjectDetector)
		IN : folder of figures
		OUT: folder(s) of cropped images, scale bars, and subfigure labels + yaml files containing output of Aster 
		STATUS: Operational (minus Aster?)
		PERFORMANCE: Untested

	[4] annotation_separator (in Annotations)
		IN : folder of cropped images
		OUT: folder of associated annotation masks
		STATUS: Operational
		PERFORMANCE: Untested
	
	[5] read_annotation_content 
		IN : folder of cropped images/ annotation masks
		OUT: csv (or another format) that contains annotation info extracted from caption 
		STATUS: Incomplete
		PERFORMANCE: N/A

	[6] cluster_master_images (which cropped image belongs to which subfigure label?)
		IN : folder(s) of cropped images, scale bars, and subfigure labels, .csv with dict of associated caption text
		OUT: folder of separated images, .csv (or another format) that contains label info extracted from caption 
		STATUS: Incomplete
		PERFORMANCE: N/A


    test v1.0 of tool: [1]-->[2]-->[3]-->[6]
    test v2.0 of tool: [0]-->[1]-->[2]-->[3]------------->[6]
                                          |                ^
                                          |-->[4]-->[5]--> |
                                          
- Needed Improvements:
	Process [0]:
		- Push code to repo
	Process [1]:
		- Extend to other journal types
	Process [2]:
		- Quantify performance 
		- "Learn" appropriate sentence search patterns
	Process [3]:
		- What to do about ASTER (figure it out, or replace it)?
		- Quantify performance 
		- Retrain YOLOv3 on MTurk labeled data
		- Integrate predicted # of images into non-max supression step? 
	Process [4]:
		- Use to assist in reading all other text on image (Process [5])
	Process [5]:
		- Decide how to do this???
	Process [6]:
		- Decide how to do this???
