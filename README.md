#MaterialEyes



##Organization

Files are organized according to the major modules of the MaterialEyes framework. They are: a [web scraper](#webscraper), that takes in keywords and outputs html files, [Chem Data Extractor](#cde) which takes in html files and outputs a csv, [a caption processor](#captions), an [object detector](#object) that detects subfigures, scale bars, and transcribes labels, an [annotations sections](#annotations), and [a module that combines the results of each component](#cluster).

These modules are organized into two separate pipelines -- version 1.0 and version 2.0. [Version 1.0](#v1) includes all modules except the annotations. [Version 2.0](#v2) includes annotations. 

##Version 1.0 <a name="v1"></a>

##Data Format
The format by which data will be stored throughout the pipeline will be a json.
