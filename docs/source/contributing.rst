Contributing to exsclaim!
==============================

If there is something you would like to add (or see added) to exsclaim,
your first step should be to check for an existing `issue <https://github.com/MaterialEyes/exsclaim/issues>`_.
If none exist for your bug/feature, create a new one. This way other people
will know you are working on it and be able to discuss.
